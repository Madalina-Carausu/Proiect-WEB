                <h2>Organic</h2>
                <p>
                    Certified organic seeds were grown with methods regulated by the USDA National Organic Program. They haven’t been treated with pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, or synthetic fertilizers. They also are <b>guaranteed not to be GMO</b>, as genetically modified seeds are strictly prohibited in organics. You will find the green or black USDA Certified Organic seal on these types of seed packets. 
                    <br><br>
                    It is important to note that many varieties are not available organically (for a variety of reasons). Even on certified organic farms, some seeds must be sourced conventional <b>due to lack of availability</b>. As long as seeds have not been treated with fungicides or fertilizers, they are still safe to use in organic production. Search for “untreated” or “NOP-compliant pellet.”

                <h2>Open Pollinated</h2>
                <p>
                    If a seed is open pollinated (OP), that means it can freely cross-breed with its neighbors. If it is pollinated by other plants of the same variety, it will produce offspring that is true-to-type. OP seeds are <b>not hybridized</b>, so they are the best option for anyone interested in saving seeds. OP seeds also require wind, pollinators, or humans to pollinate their flowers so that they can yield fruit.  
                    <br><br>
                    The only caveat here is, if you grow multiple types of OP squash, for example, <b>a bee may easily cross-pollinate them</b> and produce unique seeds that are not necessarily true to the original variety.

                <h2>Heirloom</h2>
                <p>
                    Heirlooms are old lineages of plant varieties, typically defined as being <b>passed down through generations for at least 50 years</b>. Similar to a family heirloom, these types of vegetables are like antiques. Their genetics have been preserved from the past. Heirloom tomatoes like ‘Brandywine’ and ‘Cherokee Purple’ are among the most popular heirloom seeds. All heirlooms are open-pollinated or self-pollinated, so they are also ideal for seed-savers.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="title-of-module-col">
                <h2>Hybrid</h2>
                <p>
                    Hybridized seeds are made by crossing two different varieties of the same plant. For example, a plant breeder may want the vigor and flavor of one type of cucumber crossed with the disease resistance of another type of cucumber. Over years of <b>cross-pollinating and selecting for the desired offspring</b>, F1 hybrid seeds are finally created and their lines are maintained by seed companies. There are many Certified Organic F1 hybrid seed varieties available.  
                    <br><br>
                    Though it’s not a perfect analogy, hybrid seeds can be <b>compared to breeding specialty dog breeds</b> like Goldendoodles. A dog breeder selects the best Golden Retriever female and the best Poodle male, crosses them together, and creates puppies that have unique traits. The puppies of those original parents will not always produce the same genes as the initial cross. To maintain the lineage, only certain dogs will be bred again.  
                    <br><br>
                    Like Goldendoodle puppies, hybrid seeds <b>do not save true-to-type</b>, so they are not good options for gardeners who want to save seeds. The offspring will be widely varied and carry many different traits from the original parents.

                <h2>GMO</h2>
                <p>
                    Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) seeds are often very controversial in the agricultural world. They are <b>prohibited in organic production</b> yet widely used in conventional chemical agriculture. GMO seeds have genes that are manipulated in a laboratory setting to produce certain traits. For example, resistance to the spraying of RoundUp, or inserting of a bacterial toxin called Bt that kills caterpillars.  
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, GMOs are only common in commodity agriculture such as <b>soy, wheat, alfalfa, corn, and potatoes</b>. Gardeners don’t usually have to worry about GMO seeds and would certainly not benefit from using them. All Certified Organic seed is non-GMO.
