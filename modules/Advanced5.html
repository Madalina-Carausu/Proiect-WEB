                    <h2>Grow Crops That Store Themselves</h2>
                    <p>As long as they’re handled gently and given time to cure, dry beans, garlic, onions, sweet potatoes and winter squash will keep for months in a cool, dry place — no processing required. Growing types that store for a long time, such as butternut squash and shallots, will allow you to eat fresh food from your garden all winter. </p>

                    <h2>Build a Root Cellar</h2>
                    <p>Storing crops in a passively cooled basement root cellar is one of the most efficient ways to preserve food. You can even make one yourself by following these plans for a DIY root cellar. </p>

                    <h2>Freeze in Small Batches</h2>
                    <p>Much less garden produce will go to waste if you freeze the extra in small batches every few days. For example, add chopped peppers, cubed summer squash, green beans, peas or sweet corn to small sealable bags or containers and toss them in the freezer. You can also try mix-and-match bags of similar veggies, such as chopped kale with chard. Freezing is less technical than canning, with far fewer limitations on how vegetables can be combined. Add packets of veggies to soups, pastas or other dishes.</p>

                    <h2>Learn How to Can</h2>
                    <p>One of the easiest and most popular ways to put by food is water bath canning, which involves submersing jars filled with homegrown goodies — such as tomatoes, tomato sauce, pickles, relishes, jams and jellies — in barely boiling water. Canning has a delightful finality to it, as many properly canned foods last for more than a year. In my experience, canned pickles are best if eaten within a year, but tomato sauce and canned pears are as good after two years as they are after one. This means if I end the winter with an excess of, say, tomato sauce, I cut back a tomato plant or two in the coming year’s planting plan. Even if you don’t grow your own produce, canning is a useful skill to learn, enabling you to make use of seasonal fruits and vegetables when they’re abundant at local farmers markets. </p>

                    <h2>Network for Free Pickings</h2>
                    <p>Go online to locate organic gardeners and farmers with excess produce on their hands. Local Freecycle groups can help you find people with unpicked apples or blemished pears, or you can use local e-bulletin boards to ask for what you want. If you have friends or relatives who grow big gardens or have mature fruit trees, ask them to call you when they have too much of something. </p>

                    <h2>Try Drying</h2>
                    <p>Among self-sufficient gardeners, there is a trend toward drying as a food preservation method. After you dry fruits and vegetables in a solar dehydrator or an electric dehydrator (or in the sun in arid climates), they take up much less space and keep their shelf quality for many months under good conditions. You won’t have to worry about losing your stored food because of a blackout or broken freezer, and cooking with dried celery, mushrooms, peppers and tomatoes is oh-so-simple. To ensure you don’t lose dried goods to bug invaders or too much moisture, properly store them in airtight containers.</p>

                    <h2>Take Stock in Late Winter.</h2>
                    <p>Before you plant your spring garden, take stock of what you have left in the root cellar, freezer and in dried batches. Did you run out of something in December that you were yearning for in January and February? Do you have lots of some items left, and aren’t sure whether you’ll be able to use them up? Take notes of what you’d like more of and less of in the upcoming year, and adjust your garden plans accordingly. </p>
