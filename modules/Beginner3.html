                <h2>Choosing Your Garden Beds</h2>
                <p>
                    A bed is simply where vegetables, herbs, or perennial plants are grown. It is helpful to <b>divide garden beds 
                    from other areas of the yard</b> to keep grass from encroaching in. Clearly marked beds also help keep kids and 
                    pets out of the garden. 
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of shape, curvy artsy garden beds are super fun, but they can be harder to maintain and irrigate. 
                    This is the reason farmers grow <b>in straight lines</b>. However, if you prefer a more wild or native garden, by all 
                    means, build some crazy beds!   
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="title-of-module-col">
                <h2>Raised Beds </h2>
                <p>
                    Raised beds are typically the best option for small-scale urban and suburban gardeners. They<b> don’t require super 
                    complicated construction skills</b> and they work great on top of existing lawns or poor soils because you are building 
                    upward. It is also easier to maintain grass or wood chip landscaping around raised beds. Also, if you have a gopher 
                    or rodent issue, it is easy to install hardware cloth at the bottom of a raised bed to keep them from digging 
                    underneath your vegetables. 
                    <br><br>
                    Raised beds are large planting boxes that can be made to fit your style and budget. The most common materials are 
                    untreated lumber (double-check it is not pressure-treated or painted), large logs, or even galvanized cattle troughs. 
                    For elderly people or those with back pain, you can design raised beds that are 2-3 feet tall <b>for less bending over</b>, 
                    but keep in mind this will require a lot more soil or compost to fill the boxes themselves.

                <h2>In-Ground </h2>
                <p>
                    In-ground beds are more like a production farm or market garden. These are best if you have more space, a tighter budget, 
                    and/or moderately healthy soil that has not been treated with herbicides. The best way to begin in-ground beds is with 
                    the tarping method described in the next module.  
                    <br><br>
                    Next, use a tape measure, string, and stakes to mark out your beds (we typically standardize our beds 30” wide and 10-50 
                    feet long). Be sure to leave a pathway between each bed that gives you enough room to stand, kneel, haul a wheelbarrow, 
                    and set a harvest tote.     
                    <br><br>
                    When your beds are marked, we recommend adding a layer of compost on top of each bed to raise them up above the ground. 
                    You can also use the lasagna method described in the next module. If your soil is already of good quality, you can simply 
                    broadfork, rake, and then prepare for planting!  
                </p>

                <h2>Perennial Landscaping Beds </h2>
                <p>
                    You may be familiar with standard landscaping beds that surround your home. This style of garden bed is perfect 
                    for perennials, which are woody and herbaceous plants that stay alive year after year. The opposite of perennials 
                    is annuals, which have to be replanted every year from starts or seeds. Most vegetables are annuals. Fruit trees, 
                    ground berries, many herbs, and ornamental landscape plants are typically perennial. 
                    <br><br>
                    To establish landscaping beds, begin by tarping or mulching existing vegetation. The mulch can be compost, topsoil, 
                    woodchips, or another weed-smothering material. Next, line your beds with bricks or rocks. You will need to measure out 
                    the recommended spacing between perennials and take into account how big they will be at full size. Double-digging the 
                    planting holes for perennials like certain berries or apple trees will help them take off and yield more quickly.
